# Stock-Market-Analysis

Visualized the financial data of popular stocks like Apple, AMD(Advanced Micro Devices), Amazon, Tesla and Gamestop using interactive Candlestick chart and Line Chart.
Investigated Tesla and Gamestop stocks to find concrete reasons for jump in their price and found Tesla to be genuine as it's rise based on increase in revenue growth. On the other hand, found high fluctuating spikes in the yearly revenue generated by the GameStop and suspect market manipulation for it's high share prices.
